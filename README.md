##[Final Presentation Slide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1AYvPm52p2j-T5Eg2OVSnM34USyKKRwQG6whOnzoRA_o/edit?usp=sharing)
This repository contains the codebase for a Final Year BSc. thesis project aimed at addressing one of the major challenges in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia - swift response to car accidents and requesting aid for severe accidents. The project aims to alleviate traffic congestion caused by accidents by providing prompt assistance for both minor and severe incidents.

## Project Overview
The Car Accident Response System includes a hardware component installed in vehicles, which can detect accidents and automatically report them. Upon detection, nearby traffic police are notified via a mobile application. The mobile application comprises three distinct interfaces:

- **Admin Side**: Administrators manage system settings and user accounts.
- **Police Side**: Traffic police receive real-time accident notifications and can respond accordingly.
- **Driver Side**: Drivers have access to features like requesting aid for severe accidents and reporting minor incidents.

## Repository Structure
- **Backend**: Node.js backend responsible for managing server-side logic and communication.
- **Frontend**: Flutter/Dart frontend for the mobile application, providing a user-friendly interface.
- **Hardware Microcontroller Code**: C codebase for the hardware component installed in vehicles, facilitating accident detection and reporting.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Node.js
- **Frontend**: Flutter/Dart
- **Hardware Microcontroller**: C

## Usage
To deploy the Car Accident Management System, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Set up the backend by navigating to the backend directory and following the provided instructions.
3. Configure the hardware microcontroller code according to your vehicle's specifications and install it.
4. Build and deploy the frontend mobile application using Flutter/Dart.
